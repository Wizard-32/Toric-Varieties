# Toric-Varieties

# blowup
Contains the code that takes the Newton Polygon and constructs the resolution, with the intersection numbers of all boundary divisors.

 # Fans and subdvisions
Used for the interface here: https://www.geogebra.org/python/index.html

Draws the vectors corresponding to the normal fan and its resolution.

 # smoothSurfaces
Constructs a smooth (toric) surface with the given intersection numbers. It does that by making sure it ends up at either the projective plane or a Hirzebruch surface after suitable contractions.

 Further, it also takes the surface as a list of self-intersection number, constructs the 2-parameterr family of Newton Polygons, and check if any of these are 'good', i.e., volume is the lattice perimeter squared.
